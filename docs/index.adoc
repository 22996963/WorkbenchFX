API Users of WorkbenchFX don't only care about the API design, but also about the customizibility.
They want to be able to define their own design to ensure it blends in with the design of their components.
The standard for custom controls in JavaFX is to use an implementation based on a control, separated from the skin. TODO: source?
TODO: maybe explain a little with graphics how this structure works?

We look at architectures of existing large JavaFX Applications, like CalendarFX from Dirk Lemmermann. TODO: add link


==== Persona
Who is the persona?

* Programmer (-> Usage of WorkbenchFX)
* User of the application (-> GUI)


==== Layout
Challenge:

* Broad spectrum of usage possibilities (-> reduce to one central use case / user story)

During looking for a fitting GUI, we looked at several applications

* Blender (Tool for creating 3D models)
** Blender is divided up into five sections.
*** Header --> Most important and the common settings
*** Left Bar --> Tools
*** Right Bar --> Tools
*** Footer --> Animation, and view-modes
*** Center --> The model, which is created
** All sections are resizable
** If their size becomes 0, they disappear but can be restored using the short code (-)
** Using short codes to show/hide the bars. (+)
Each bar has it's own short code.
There is no animation, when showing or hiding.
No possibility to show/hide the bars manually (-)
** Top right corner --> drag and create so a new window.
Each window shows the same part, but it's view is independent. (+)
To delete the window: Drag the corner back (-)
** Items in a bar can be moved manually, but only in the bar itself.
The bar itself is fixed and can't be moved.
** Items in the bar can be collapsed, in order to save space and make it cleaner.
** The tools in the toolbar are stored in tabs.
** When creating a new project, all settings are restored to default, so nothing can be destroyed. (+ probably give the user opportunity to choose)

* Photoshop / Illustrator

* IntelliJ

* MSOffice

* Sublime Text
