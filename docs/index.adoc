=== Syntax
Fluent API or not?

=== First thoughts
==== Persona
Who is the persona?

* Programmer (-> Usage of WorkbenchFX)
* User of the application (-> GUI)


==== Layout
Challenge:

* Broad spectrum of usage possibilities (-> reduce to one central use case / user story)
* Unique glossary --> Like in the previous project, we aknowledge, that a shared understanding with the customer is needed.
Thus, we're going to define a unique glossary.
So everyone talks the same language.

To gather information and best practices in order to fulfill the needs of the project, we're going to look at several applications.
This includes features, usability and general appearance of the specific workbench.

===== Blender (Tool for creating 3D models)
* Blender is divided up into five sections.
** Header --> Most important and the common settings
** Left Bar --> Tools
** Right Bar --> Tools
** Footer --> Animation, and view-modes
** Center --> The model, which is created
* All sections are resizable
* If their size becomes 0, they disappear but can be restored using the short code (-)
* Using short codes to show/hide the bars. (+)
Each bar has it's own short code.
There is no animation, when showing or hiding.
No possibility to show/hide the bars manually (-)
* Top right corner --> drag and create so a new window.
Each window shows the same part, but it's view is independent. (+)
To delete the window: Drag the corner back (-)
* Items in a bar can be moved manually, but only in the bar itself.
The bar itself is fixed and can't be moved.
* Items in the bar can be collapsed, in order to save space and make it cleaner.
* The tools in the toolbar are stored in tabs.
* When creating a new project, all settings are restored to default, so nothing can be destroyed. (+ probably give the user opportunity to choose)

===== Photoshop / Illustrator (Design tools)
* Photoshop (Image tool, Pixel based)
**

* Illustrator (Design tool, Vector based)
** Multiple windows possible. Are per default in the background opened. Navigation is done by tabs. (+)
** Tabs can be navigated to other places.
This is done by drag and drop
** Tabs can be placed anywhere in the application (- Needs for sure to be discussed. Has certainly it's advantages)
** Workspace can be restored to default using the equivalent setting. (+)
Custom workspaces can be stored. (+)
Multiple workspaces can be stored and it can be switched to. (+)
** Tabs
*** When double-clicking on the Tabs, they collapse (+)
*** They have 3 states (not likely to understand) and it's collapsing behaviour is not intuitive. (-)
**4

===== IntelliJ
* all possibilities available
* "Remove from sidebar" removes the feature from the sidebar and it's not intuitive to restore this. (-)
* "Restore default layout" doesn't restore all layout changes (-)
* Layout changes should be stored at one place.

===== MSOffice

===== Sublime Text

===== Minimal viable product
As a result of our research we have enough information to create the most valuable workbench for our use case.
Nonetheless we need to break down the functionality to it's simplest scenario.
This way, we can assure our customer, that he minimal viable product as a result from this project.
The reason why we do this is, that this way both parties are talking the same language regarding the expectations of the outcome of the project.
Furthermore it's an assurance for both of them.

=== Challenges

=== Architecture
WorkbenchFX seems like a gigantic pane.
Maybe the panes are giving us some inspiration?

=== Testing
